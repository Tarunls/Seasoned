<h1> Seasoned </h1>

<h3> A simple, minimalistic way to plan meals on the go, as well as track your caloric and macronutrient intake </h3>

Inspiration üí°

Our team was always interested in our health and physical well-being. Working out and staying in shape have always been some of our most important priorities. However, there are times in life when you just aren't able to prepare proper meals or find the best food to fit your life style and dietary/fitness goals.
What it does üç¥

Even when the only option you have is fast food, you still want to be able to hit your macros and nutrients. The mobile app generates a personalized meal plan based your needs. This includes cutting, bulking and maintaining weight. Your personal plan includes macros that you've already consumed, and generates a number of possible fast food meals that fit in your fitness journey.

If you're feeling peckish, the app also includes a scanner that reads the barcode of packaged snacks and drinks. After scanning, the app will tell you the macro value and if it fits into your plan, adjusting the future meals accordingly.
How we built it ‚öôÔ∏è

Seasoned was built using a combination of node.js, javascript, and react-native. The frontend was designed in Adobe Xd and built using react-native. The javascript code was then styled using CSS.

Challenges we ran into üö®

    Converting CSS to React-Native CSS
    Open-AI tokens (resolved!)
    Lots of bugs

Design and Icon üé®

Our team opted for a minimal design, with hints of Material UI to be functional and easily understandable. The color theme revolves around the apples in the icon, which are dumbbells, illustrating the nature of the app, for weightlifting and health.

Accomplishments that we're proud of üòÅ

    Completing a functional project in less than 25 hours.
    Some of our members were able to reach a higher level of proficiency in front end development during the very short 25 hours (from 0 to hero!)
    Turning an idea into something truly useful that we would gladly use on a day to day basis.

What we learned ü§ì

    Pace yourself..., although it is good to get an early start on things and try and finish as much as possible, it is crucial to take your time with things as well as take plenty of breaks. The breaks allow your brain to rest which will help foster creativity as well as the ability to work longer, especially into the later hours of the night!
    Teamwork makes the dream-work..., even the members less experienced, can provide a helpful tool in the creation of the projects, splitting up the work evenly can allow for people to always have something to do as well as decrease the maximum stress of the usually most work-bearing group member.
    Have fun! As much as this is a competition, you are with like minded individuals who want to pursue innovation in the computer science world, this should be treated as a learning experience as much as it is a competition.

What's next for Seasoned üîú

    Future (possible) implementation of scanning home-made dishes and estimating the macro-nutrients inside the meal
    Future implementation of restaurants outside of fast food.
    Proximity, Price, and Preference factors will be included in calculating the most optimal meal plan for the user.
